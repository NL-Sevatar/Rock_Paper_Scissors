# Rock_Paper_Scissors

This was a simple first project to test my knowledge of javascript and utilizing functions. This took me longer than expected to create working functions and nesting else ifs within more else ifs. There is most likely a better way to achieve this with less code but my main concern was creating a functional programs to lay the foundations down.

As I progress upon my path as a programmer I strive to learn how to code with more simplicity to achieve my goals and make it easier to read and troubleshoot not just for myself but for others as well. This did really help cement the concepts of scopes and utilizing functions within functions to achieve my end result. I believe now fully in building a function to have a single purpose and chain together functions to create the multi-tasking program as simple as I can.
